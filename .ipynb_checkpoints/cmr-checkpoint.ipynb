      "The Office of Polar Programs, Antarctic Integrated and System Science Program has made this award to support an interdisciplinary study of the effects of the ocean on the stability of glacial ice in the most dynamic region the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, namely the Pine Island Glacier in the Amundsen Sea Embayment. The collaborative project builds on the knowledge gained by the highly successful West Antarctic Ice Sheet program and is being jointly sponsored with NASA. Recent observations indicate a significant ice loss, equivalent to 10% of the ongoing increase in sea-level rise, in this region. These changes are largest along the coast and propagate rapidly inland, indicating the critical impact of the ocean on ice sheet stability in the region. While a broad range of remote sensing and ground-based instrumentation is available to characterize changes of the ice surface and internal structure (deformation, ice motion, melt) and the shape of the underlying sediment and rock bed, instrumentation has yet to be successfully deployed for observing boundary layer processes of the ocean cavity which underlies the floating ice shelf and where rapid melting is apparently occurring. Innovative, mini ocean sensors that can be lowered through boreholes in the ice shelf (about 500 m thick) will be developed and deployed to automatically provide ocean profiling information over at least three years. Their data will be transmitted through a conducting cable frozen in the borehole to the surface where it will be further transmitted via satellite to a laboratory in the US. Geophysical and remote sensing methods (seismic, GPS, altimetry, stereo imaging, radar profiling) will be applied to map the geometry of the ice shelf, the shape of the sub ice-shelf cavity, the ice surface geometry and deformations within the glacial ice. To integrate the seismic, glaciological and oceanographic observations, a new 3-dimensional coupled ice-ocean model is being developed which will be the first of its kind. NASA is supporting satellite based research and the deployment of a robotic-camera system to explore the environment in the ocean cavity underlying the ice shelf and NSF is supporting all other aspects of this study.\n",

      "Argo profiling floats were deployed during the SIMBA cruise.  A total of 23 floats were deployed along the cruise track from Punta Arenas to the Bellingshausen Sea.  These floats drifted at a depth of 1000 meters; at 10-day intervals, each float sank to a depth of 2000 m and then ascended to the sea surface over a period of approximately 6 hours, collecting a CTD profile as it ascended.  Many of the floats were also equipped with dissolved oxygen sensors.  Once on the sea surface, the floats transmitted their data to a satellite and descended again to 1000 m to begin another 10-day cycle.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Each float was capable of collecting 200 or more profiles in this manner.  The floats were equipped with ice-avoidance software in order to decrease the probability that they could be crushed by drifting ice while transmitting on the sea surface.  As the floats ascended between depths of 50 and 30 meters, they examined the median temperature in this depth range; if the temperature was below a critical temperature that was indicative of ice cover above (chosen to be -1.77°C), the float turn off its buoyancy pump in order to stop its ascent.  In such a case, the float decelerated and then stopped at a depth of about 3 meters; the float then stored the data collected and descended back to 1000 m.  This process continued for as many profiles and 10-day intervals as necessary until the float was able to reach the sea surface, at which time it transmitted all stored profiles. Each float stored as many as 70 high-resolution profiles in this manner, or nearly 2 years’ worth of data.  The floats all used the relatively high-bandwidth Iridium satellite system for communication. After the NB Palmer departed Punta Arenas, floats were deployed in Drake Passage and then along the ice edge, near the 2000 m isobath.  A few floats were reprogrammed so that they can be deployed in shallower water on the shelf, where the ice cover is more permanent.   Leading up to and during week 1 of field work (Sep 23-29) seventeen expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) were deployed in conjunction with 17 Argo floats between 62 south and 69S.  The remaining floats were deployed in conjunction with a CTD cast from the vessel.\n",

      "The work is in collaboration with co-PI Christina Hulbe and at Portland State University.  In our previous work we were able to image, map, and interpret streak lines (flow trajectories) on the Ross Ice Shelf and demonstrate, using numerical simulations, that this pattern of flow-related features required significant changes in flow direction in the outflows of a number of ice streams on the Siple Coast of West Antarctica. In the present project, we have expanded the suite of features to include fracture patterns mapped from satellite imagery, expanded the modeling work to capture the impact of grounding and ungrounding of ice in the mouths of ice streams, and we have worked to constrain stop and start cycles recorded by the features out in the Ross Ice Shelf.  \n",

      "      \n",
      "      \"Flow features on the surface of the Ross Ice Shelf, West Antarctica, record two episodes of ice stream stagnation and reactivation within the last 1000 years. We document these events using maps of streaklines emerging from individual ice streams made using visible band imagery, together with numerical models of ice shelf flow. Forward model experiments demonstrate that only a limited set of discharge scenarios could have produced the current streakline configuration. According to our analysis, Whillans Ice Stream ceased rapid flow about 850 calendar years ago and restarted about 400 years later and MacAyeal Ice Stream either stopped or slowed significantly between 800 and 700 years ago, restarting about 150 years later. Until now, ice-stream scenarios emphasized runaway retreat or stagnation on millennial time scales. Here, we identify a new scenario: century-scale stagnation and reactivation cycles, as well as lateral communication with adjacent ice streams through thickness changes on lightly grounded ice plains. This introduces uncertainty into predictions for future sea-level withdrawls by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which are based in part on recent slowing of Whillans Ice Stream and the stagnant condition of Kamb Ice Stream.\"\n",
      "      \n",
      "      This paper documents the evidence for delimiting the source regions (provenance) of ice now in the shelf; for bracketing the possible discharge scenarios that could have produced the patterns captured in the shelf, and shows that it is difficult to reproduce these patterns with a model without stopping and restarting individual streams.  The modeling facilitated by Co-PI Hulbe’s system has allowed us to cover a range of possible scenarios, and in the process to learn about other aspects of the behavior of this system.  The flow variability recorded in the ice shelf provides an important reference history against which current changes can be put in context.\n",

      "      Some other findings (some of them in this paper, some from the last year of the project):\n",
      "      \n",
      "      Major, rapid, bi-directional translations of the grounding line have occurred, are common in the recent past, and are very likely to be going on now.  This conclusion is required by the changes in flow and crevassing recorded in the ice shelf.  It is a direct consequence of changing ice stream discharge across a low-slope grounding zone – small changes in ice thickness can produce large horizontal changes in grounding line location.  Although there is limited knowledge of the cavity shape under the Ross Ice Shelf, the gently sloping floor downstream of the Siple Coast ice streams is fairly well constrained.  Thickness variations out on the Ross Ice Shelf from ICESAT data (courtesy of Christopher Shuman) show strong gradients along and across flow that should decay rapidly over time; their presence suggests recent ungrounding in several areas.  Early model work by MacAyeal on the thickness signatures to be expected on an ice shelf from an ice stream shutdown are large only local to the grounding line – and we in fact see a combination of thickness changes and flow provenance that reveals the impact of changes in the mouths of ice streams, but decays farther out on the shelf.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      Ice stream restarting is required by the lack of Whillans ice stream ice out in the ice shelf; this corresponds in estimated time with changes upstream of Engelhardt Ice Ridge (Scambos and Conway).  The time available for restarting is significantly shorter than the millennium-length period required to substantially thicken the ice and change either the basal thermal gradient or basal shear stress, which has been the prevailing model of how streams may restart.  This strongly points to more variable parts of the system as possible mechanisms – basal water being the most likely.  Basal water movement is very common on Whillans, Bindschadler and MacAyeal ice streams based on time series of ICESat laser altimeter data, which show meters of vertical elevation change over multiple months for a series of lakes (Fricker et al).  This type of water flow could restart a stopped stream, if it could be effective in the right places.  The implications of this for possible field measurements that would document the process will require more work.  The complex layers of dirty and clean ice seen at the base of the Caltech borehole on Kamb ice stream may reflect intermittent freeze-on and restarting of flow in this area.\n",
      "      \n",
      "      The seemingly disparate conclusions of the work of Catania et al, and Catania and Hulbe, from surface-based radar profiling of the past margins and floating regions in the lower reaches of Kamb ice stream, and Anandakrishnan, Bindschadler, and more recently Weins about the twice-daily episodic stick-slip motion on the ice plain of Whillans ice stream can be connected based on an analysis of the detailed topography of these regions.  Many of the conclusions of Catania et al about the recent history of the ice at the mouth of Kamb ice stream are borne out by this comparison, though relating the features produced by basal melting at the edges of Siple Dome and Engelhardt ice rise to old grounding lines is problematic given the amount of vertical relief along the length of these features today.  The nucleation points of the slip events, centered around Ice Raft A in the ice plain of Whillans ice stream is characterized by local rises which can reach 10+ meters but are features only a kilometer across.  These are likely produced when ice flows across a bed feature that inhibits sliding.  On longer time scales, this detailed topography provides a quantitative picture of the flow variations that are also shown in the modeling of ice stream start/stop behavior and grounding line migration by Hulbe at Portland State University; further analysis of the combination of these data should yield additional insight.\n",

      "Twenty-seven basal crevasses, with an average spacing of 1.2 km, are identified along a 31 km transect aligned with the flow direction of the ice shelf downstream of Cabinet Inlet.  Basal crevasses are identified by strong hyperbolic reflections within the ice column (Figure 1; black arrows) and two, nearly symmetric hyperbolas at the bottom corners of the crevasse (Figure 1; yellow arrows).  The underside of the ice shelf is highly fractured in the initial 2 km of the transect, however, a smooth basal surface exists along the remainder of the transect (Figure 1).  Crevasse spacing ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 km and does not systematically vary along the length of the transect.  Penetration height of the basal crevasses is greatest near the origin, where they extend 120-134 m into the ice column (Figure 2).  Height subsequently decreases along the length of the profile, decreasing by ~40 m in the first 15 km while remaining nearly constant over the remaining ~15 km (Figure 2).  In addition to a decrease in absolute height, the relative penetration height (as a function of ice thickness) also decreases from ~40% to 25%.  Initially, the bottom width of the basal crevasses is quite narrow (20-70 m) and at times, difficult to determine due to the overlap of the two hyperbolas that originate from the bottom corners of the crevasse (Figure 1A, yellow arrow).  The opening width of the basal crevasses increases along the length of the transect, opening ~100 m in the first 15 km, while ranging between 150-240 m over the remaining ~15 km (Figure 2; black line).  The surface undulations have an amplitude of 3-4 m, although the amplitude of these features are likely much larger proximal to Churchill Peninsula, as the radar transect was conducted near the edge of the features.  Internal layering within the firn shows significant downwarping of 11-18 m above the basal crevasses, with deeper layers showing greater downwarping (Figure 1, red arrows).  \n",

      "Surface undulations on the ice shelf are easily identified in both MODerate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; 250 m) and Landsat (15 m) imagery as a series of parallel alternating dark and light bands (Figure 1).  In total, 102 undulations, with the troughs aligned with the basal crevasses, are observed along a 155 km flow line transect. High-resolution commercial visible imagery (GeoEye; 1.65 m resolution) clearly shows a lack of surface crevassing upstream of the origin of the basal crevasses (Figure 3a).  Surface crevassing, first observed as narrow (1-5 m) bridged features, is apparent where the first surface undulations are observed (Figure 3b).  The surface crevasses become increasingly abundant and well defined in the along flow direction, reaching widths of 8-24 m, while remaining primarily aligned with the crests of the surface undulations (Figure 3c). \n",

      "Visible imagery details a series of isolated surface depressions in the main outflow of Cabinet Inlet, extending seaward to the calving front (Figure 4a). We focus our observations on one of these features (Figure 4b). The surface depression has a maximum depth of 13.0 m and extends for 4.5 km, as measured from kinematic GPS and imagery, respectively (Figure 4b). A large hyperbolic reflection within the ice column is aligned with the surface depression, which we interpret as the apex of a basal crevasse (Figure 2a). It extends 233 ± 11 m in height from the base of the ice shelf, penetrating through over 66% of the mean local ice thickness and is 470 m in width (Figure 5a and b). The size of the basal crevasse increases the local ice-ocean interface by ~30% relative to a flat-bottomed ice shelf. Above the hyperbolic reflection, the firn and upper ice layers down warp by 15-20 m (Figure 5a). Numerous snow-bridged surface crevasses, with widths between 20-25 m, are aligned parallel to the basal crevasse but on the down sloping flanks of the surface depression, as observed in both the visible imagery (Figure 4b; shadowed features indicated by red arrow) and in the hyperbolic reflections in the upper 10 m of the radargram (Figure 5a; highlighted in red). \n",

      "We attribute the formation of the surface crevasses to bending stresses induced as the ice shelf surface deforms in order to reach a modified hydrostatic equilibrium [McGrath et al., 2012]. We offer the following observations here to support this hypothesis. We observe two nascent basal crevasses, which are located upstream from the series that extend seaward from Churchill Peninsula, which have propagated to a similar height but have limited surface deformation (1-4 m) and no apparent surface crevassing (Figure 6). Further along flow (i.e. with increased temporal evolution), the basal crevasses have clearly defined surface depressions, down warped firn and ice layers above the basal crevasse and numerous surface crevasses adjacent to the basal crevasse [McGrath et al., 2012]. Together, these observations suggest that the basal crevasse forms first, subsequently followed by surface deformation, the visco-elastic response to the reduced ice thickness above the basal crevasse. However, as this thinner section is partially supported by the full thickness ice to either side, the resulting geometry induces bending stresses, with tension across the crests and down the flanks, sufficient to induce surface crevassing, and compression in the surface depressions, which are free of surface crevasses (Figure 1b).\n",

      "The significance of basal crevasses, especially in the context of meltwater ponding and hydrofracture is highlighted below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meltwater-driven hydrofracture, the process by which water filled surface crevasses fracture downwards, has been suggested to be an important mechanism in the final break up of several ice shelves [Weertman, 1973; van der Veen, 1998, 2007; Scambos et al., 2000; 2003]. We have shown that basal crevasses, beyond introducing large-scale ice shelf weaknesses, can create both surface depressions and surface crevasses. The most apparent implication of meltwater ponding in the surface depression is if the meltwater were to intersect a flanking surface crevasse, and subsequently establish a channel by which the pond could drain, thereby providing the necessary water volume for continued fracture. Perhaps less obvious, however, is that the increased load in the trough will increase extensional stresses along the flanks and in the vicinity of the basal crevasse apex, potentially leading to further propagation and the possibility for a shear fracture to connect these features [Bassis and Walker, 2012]. This structural weakness could be further exploited if hydrofracture originates from the base of the surface trough, where the hydrostatic pressure is the greatest, and where, despite the large-scale compressional environment, incipient surface cracks / fractures are still likely to be present [Fountain et al., 2005]. The presence of the basal crevasse greatly reduces the ice thickness in the vicinity, thereby minimizing the distance through which these small fractures have to propagate prior to creating a full-thickness rift. While the surface crevasses certainly weaken the ice shelf, this latter case highlights the possibility that it is the presence of the basal crevasse that is more important for ice shelf stability. Basal crevasses are an order of magnitude larger in width and depth than the surface crevasses they create, and by concentrating meltwater ponding directly above them, they can control fracture location, and therefore, ice shelf disintegration. \n",
      "                \n",
      "In addition to the observations of melt pond drainage on Larsen B, sediment cores retrieved from beneath both the former Larsen A and Prince Gustav Ice Shelves, record spatially discrete sediment pulses interpreted as the drainage of supraglacial lakes and/or crevasses prior to the ice shelf disintegration event [Gilbert and Domack, 2003]. Together, these observations provide clear evidence that fractures do propagate through the ice shelves, although the location where the hydrofracture originated is unclear (i.e. whether it was a proximal surface crevasse or incipient flaw beneath the pond). A corollary can be drawn to supraglacial lake drainage on the Greenland Ice Sheet, where fractures, and later moulins, develop within the lake boundary [Das et al., 2008]. Thus, if hydrofracture does originate from within the pond boundary, the presence of the basal crevasse should make the formation of a full-thickness rift exceedingly efficient.   \n",

      "Analysis of the automatic weather station data is ongoing and is focused on conditions that are conducive to surface meltwater production.  Particular attention is being paid to föhn events, in which air that passes over the peninsula is adiabatically warmed, and leads to meltwater production on Larsen C.  The climate of the peninsula has been relatively cool over the 4 years of the project.  We considered this recent variability in the context of the 30-50 yr climate trends in McGrath and Steffen, 2012.  \n",

      "Atmospheric warming over the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) during the second half of the twentieth century was remarkable, with local trends exceeding 0.5°C decade-1 (Vaughan et al. 2003; Turner et al. 2005). The complexity of atmospheric and oceanic circulation around the AP precludes clear attribution of this warming, although modified circulation patterns, largely driven by changes in latitudinal pressure gradients measured by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index, likely played an important role (Vaughan et al. 2001; Thompson and Soloman, 2002; Marshall 2003, 2007; van den Broeke and van Lipzig, 2004). There has been increased advection of warm, maritime air towards the AP, coupled with increased upwelling of Circumpolar Deep Water onto the continental shelf of the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea (ABS; Orr et al. 2008; Jacobs et al. 2011; Martinson 2011). Dramatic reductions in sea ice extent (-6.6% decade-1) in the ABS likely contributed to this warming as well, possibly as a driver and certainly as a positive feedback (Meredith and King 2005; Turner et al. 2009; Stammerjohn et al. 2012).   \n",

      "In contrast to the strong warming trends observed during the previous half-century, between 2000 and 2011, AP stations have shown much greater variability, with many stations showing a slight cooling trend (Fig. 7). The mean annual temperature trend at Marambio station switched from a warming of  0.65 ± 0.47°C decade-1 between 1971 and 2000 to a cooling of -1.57 ± 2.4° C decade-1 between 2000 and 2011. The cooling has been strongest at other northern AP stations (Bellingshausen, O’Higgins, Esperanza), with a cooling trend of about -0.7°C decade-1 over the last 15 years, following a tendency that started with the end of the 1998 El Niño. However, marked cooling is also evident on the Larsen C Ice Shelf, the largest remaining ice shelf on the AP, located on its eastern edge. This site has cooled by -1.11 ± 2.4°C decade-1 between 2000 and 2011, although interannual variability is large. It is important to note that none of the reported trends over the past decade are statistically significant, and cooling of a similar magnitude previously occurred over short time periods earlier in the record (Fig. 7). However, with the observed variability over the past decade, there is no longer a statistically significant (p\n",
