Notes from the [Icesat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov) hackweek at UW June 17 - 21 2019. 
While NASA-Goddard is managing the mission the Icesat2 data products are
described at the [NSIDC DAAC](https://nsidc.org/data/icesat-2/products). 

The data system is called ATLAS and it is the Level 6 data product ATL06 that we focus on here. 
They are archived by day (folders) with typical HDF5 files spanning ? seconds with file volume of 100MB.
