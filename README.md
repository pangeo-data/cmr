# pangeo in relation to CMR, the NASA Common Metadata Repository


## Introduction

This repo in broad strokes asks a pangeo-centric question: 

> So NASA is funding this work to help promote access to their earth remote sensing data. In pangeo we have tremendous
> amounts of computing horsepower and organizing infrastructure... so how do we bring that to bear, by way of very 
> specific examples? And for that matter what does this NASA pantheon of data look like? And are there other resources
> of comparable type style and scope that we might also want to be aware of???


This repo in finer detail looks into the NASA CMR (Common Metadata Repository) data sources via Jupyter notebook. 
**CMR** is hypothetically 'one stop shopping' for metadata on NASA remote sensing resources (earth only).
The CMR API is accessible via the python-cmr package; so we will look at that a bit here.


Since this is NASA you are wondering 'how much longer before the acronym deluge begins?' and the answer
is of course 'Zero'. As in 'Zero longer'. **GIBS** is a related system, NASA's Global Image Browser System, 
which is hypothetically one-stop shopping for imagery. We'll consider **GIBS** to be a stretch topic.

Other NASA projects have produced different bespoke portals. For example Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) 
via GES DISC (Goddard Earth Science Data and Information Services Center)
has produced a data web app called [Giovanni]( http://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/).
